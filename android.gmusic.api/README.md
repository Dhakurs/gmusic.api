#gmusic.api: an unofficial Java API for Google Play Music
#android package

As currently built, the android package is hardwired to the loopj/android-async-http project, which is also on github. Be sure to pull that down and reference it as an Android library project reference.

Also, you will need to make a change to the loopj project as documented in loopj issue #190, unless it has been closed.
